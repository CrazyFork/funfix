# Funfix

<img src="https://funfix.org/public/logo/funfix-512.png" width="120" align="right" style="float:right; display: block; width:120px;" />

Library of data types for functional and asynchronous programming in Javascript.

Inspired by [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), [Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/)
and [Monix](https://monix.io/).

## Usage

For adding the dependency to `package.json`:

```
npm install --save funfix
```

Usage sample:

```typescript
import {Try, Option, Either} from "funfix"

const opt1 = Option.of("hello")
const opt2 = Try.of(() => "world").toOption()

const greeting =
  Option.map2(opt1, opt2, (a, b) => a + " " + b)

console.log(greeting.getOrElse("Ooops!"))
```

The library has been compiled using
[UMD (Universal Module Definition)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd),
so it should work with [CommonJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html)
and [AMD](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).

Ã€ la carte imports using
[ECMAScript 2015 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import)
is also possible:

```typescript
import { Option } from 'funfix/dist/core/option'

const opt = Option.of("hello")
```

Note that these Ã  la carte imports (that you have to import from `dist`)
only work with a toolchain that recognizes ES2015 modules and imports.

## TypeScript, Flow support

Funfix supports both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and [Flow](https://flow.org/) out of the box, being packaged with
all necessary declaration files.

```typescript
import { Try } from "funfix"

const email: string | null =
  Try.of(() => users[0].profile.email).orNull()
```

## Features Overview

The code is organized in ES2015 modules, but all types, classes and
functions are exported by the root module.

### core

Data types for expressing disjunctions:

|                |                                                                                                    |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {@link Either} | data type for expressing results with two possible outcome types (a disjoint union)                |
| {@link Option} | data type for expressing optional values                                                           |
| {@link Try}    | data type for representing the result of computations that may result in either success or failure |

Standard interfaces and tools for dealing with universal equality and
hash code generation:

|                               |                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {@link IEquals}               | an interface for defining universal equality and hash code                                                         |
| {@link is} and {@link equals} | for using `IEquals` in tests, or otherwise falls back to JavaScript's equality (`==` or `valueOf()`) |
| {@link hashCode}              | for calculating hash codes (for usage in sets and maps data structures) using `IEquals`, or otherwise falls back to calculating a hash from `.valueOf()` or from `.toString()` |
| {@link isValueObject}         | for testing if a given object implements `IEquals` |
  
Also exposes standard, reusable error types, that help with some common
scenarios, working with error types being preferable to working with
strings:

|                                 |                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {@link DummyError}              | for tagging errors used for testing purposes |
| {@link IllegalArgumentError}    | for signaling that a given argument is violating the contract of the called function or constructor |
| {@link IllegalInheritanceError} | for signaling that inheriting from a certain class is illegal |
| {@link IllegalStateError}       | for signaling that an illegal code branch was executed and thus something is wrong with the code and needs investigation (e.g. a bug) |
| {@link NoSuchElementError}      | thrown when the user expects an element to be returned from a function call, but no such element exists |
| {@link NotImplementedError}     | thrown in case an implementation is missing |
| {@link TimeoutError}            | thrown in case the execution of a procedure takes longer than expected |
| {@link CompositeError}          | for gathering multiple errors in a single reference that can expose them as a list |

Misc utilities:

|                                 |                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| {@link applyMixins}             | for working with mixins (i.e. classes used as interfaces, with methods that have default implementations), see [Mixins](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/mixins.html) for an explanation |
| {@link id}                      | is the "identity" function                                                                         |

### exec

Scheduling tasks for asynchronous execution:

|                   |                                                                                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {@link Future}    | a lawful, fast, cancelable alternative to JavaScript's `Promise`                       |
| {@link Scheduler} | the alternative to using `setTimeout` for asynchronous boundaries or delayed execution |

In support for futures and schedulers, {@link ICancelable} data types
are introduced for dealing with cancellation concerns:

|                                                    |                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {@link ICancelable} and {@link Cancelable}         | for expressing actions that can be triggered to cancel processes / dispose of resources |
| {@link IBoolCancelable} and {@link BoolCancelable} | for cancelable references that can be queried for their `isCanceled` status |
| {@link IAssignCancelable} and {AssignCancelable}   | for cancelable references that can be assigned (behave like a box for) another reference |
| {@link MultiAssignCancelable}                      | being a mutable cancelable whose underlying reference can be updated multiple times |
| {@link SingleAssignCancelable}                     | for building forward references, much like `MultiAssignCancelable` except that it can be assigned only once, triggering an error on the second attempt |
| {@link SerialCancelable}                           | being like a `MultiAssignCancelable` that cancels its previous underlying reference on updates |

And also types for expressing durations:

|                  |                                                                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {@link TimeUnit} | inspired by Java's own enumeration, representing time| elated units of measurement     |
| {@link Duration} | inspired by Scala's own type, as a type safe representation for durations              |

### effect

For suspending synchronous side-effects and functions that execute
immediately (no asynchronous boundaries):

|              |                                                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| {@link Eval} | a lawful, lazy, monadic data type, that can control evaluation, inspired by the `Eval` type in [Typelevel Cats](http://typelevel.org/cats/) and by the `Coeval` type in [Monix](https://monix.io), the equivalent of Haskell's `IO`, but that can only handle immediate execution and not async boundaries. |

N.B. an equivalent `Task` / `IO` type is coming ðŸ˜‰

### types

[Type classes]{@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class}
inspired by Haskell's standard library and by 
[Typelevel Cats]{@link http://typelevel.org/cats/}:

| {@link Functor}          | a type class exposing `map` and that obeys the laws defined in {@link FunctorLaws}                                                                                        |

| {@link Applicative}      | a type class that extends `Functor` and `Apply`, exposing `pure` and that obeys the laws defined in {@link ApplicativeLaws}                                               |
| {@link ApplicativeError} | a type class that extends `Applicative`, for applicative types that can raise errors or recover from them and that obeys the laws defined in {@link ApplicativeErrorLaws} | 
| {@link FlatMap}          | a type class that extends `Functor` and `Apply`, exposing `flatMap` and `tailRecM` and that obeys the laws defined in {@link FlatMapLaws}                                 |
| {@link Monad}            | a type class that extends `Applicative` and `FlatMap` and that obeys the laws defined in {@link MonadLaws}                                                                |
| {@link MonadError}       | a type class that extends `ApplicativeError` and `Monad`, for monads that can raise or recover from errors and that obeys the laws defined in {@link MonadErrorLaws}      |
